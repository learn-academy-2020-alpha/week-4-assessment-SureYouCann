# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: a variable with the "@" symbol

  Researched answer: In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data. We say that objects can: Do things.
